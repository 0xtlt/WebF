# WebF ðŸš€

WebF est designed to be less heavy than Json for a internet more faster

## Why a new type of file ? ðŸ¤”
At first, WebF solves the problem of the content / weight ratio of json files.  
WebF has a unique architecture with a title, content and support for meta tags
This type of architecture corresponds to numerous data exchanges that can be reduced.
For example, we imagine that your news website developed with Reactjs receives a 50% lighter article than a json file and that it would take less time.
